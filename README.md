# Tableau Stock Market
This is a replication of this [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lorna.eden#!/vizhome/WorkoutWednesday2019Week15/WorkoutWednesday2019Week15) for [Workout Wednesday 2019 Week 15](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/2019-week-15-tableau-stock-market-how-does-the-stock-compare-to-the-overall-average-or-a-date-selected-value/).

## Getting Started
You will need d3 to get the visualization to work. You can do this in 2 ways:
1. Have d3 available locally as `d3.min.js` in the same directory as `read_tableau_stock_data.js` and `ww2019wk15_tableau_stock_market.html`. You can download the d3 file from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org/).
2. Open `ww2019wk15_tableau_stock_market.html` in a text editor. Locate the line `<script src="d3.min.js"></script>` and replace it with `<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>`.

Once d3 is available, you can simply open `ww2019wk15_tableau_stock_market.html` in your browser.
